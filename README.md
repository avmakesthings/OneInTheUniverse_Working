## Description
This is the the basic skeleton for the Unity app that we're building, which uses additive scene loading. Objects that you want to persist across scenes can be added to Scene 0, which will always be loaded.

To avoid merge conflicts, feel free to duplicate scenes / scripts and push those up instead.  We can combine later.
